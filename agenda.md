- New Getting Started with keripy
    - Encrypted keystore
    - SwaggerUI
    - OOBIs
    - 2-Factor Auth with Challenge/Response

- How do you see DEL's (duplicitous event logs)?
  - How they're created/maintained?
  - Basic building blocks/what kind of messages it contains?
      - Duplicity notice message
  - Basic logic for detecting duplicity
      - monotonic logic for first seen accepted event. Once seen, always seen, never unseen. No revision possible. Detection logic upon receipt of two versions of an event at the same sn for a given AID = duplicity. Live vs Dead duplicity. Dead means one version already accepted to other is duplicitous version. Live when two version but neither has yet been accepted because not fully witnessed. Hold in escrow until one or neither is accepted. If neither then hold in escrow until a subsequent rotation designates which of the two is the valid one and so one.
      - Monotonic logic protects against continuous revision eclipse attack vulnerability such as is the case for PoW ledgers.


- Henk: **Education** - first draft of the [KERI MOOC](https://hackmd.io/nuUu5S8UQjOHXw_a53LvvA) now backupped on [github](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri-1/blob/main/docs/KERI-Mooc.md) and logged-in users can edit the hackmd file.\
What do you think is a good way to develop KERI knowledge, provoke adoption and develop more programming capacity?



- A **rubric-based eval of did:keri** - Daniel Hardman: go to https://w3c.github.io/did-rubric/ and answer all the questions about did:keri.\
Decision made Feb 8: we wait until the IETF draft for DID:KERI is finalized. Henk could contribute in draft and then propose his edits to team first.     
    
  
- **Terms and understanding**
***'SAD' and 'SAID'***, for Europeans the difference in pronunciation of SAD and SAID is hard to grasp and reproduce.
    The terms are closely related so we are not very alarmed that people confuse the terms.

        - Digest field SAID
        - escrow for witness receipts
    - KERIPY
        - Conversion to Habery (Habitat Factory) allows multiple Habs (Habitats) per shared resources
        - OpenAPI (Swagger) for ReST endpoints refactor to be more ReSTful

        - Zipped Eletron Distribution with Mithril and Material.org UX bare
        - KEEP has style guide
        - Could be adapted to Rust Backend

- Witness dissemination protocol (how Witnesses promulgate receipts to Validator network) // added by Michal
    - Validator requests key state from its Watchers 
    - Watchers request key state from other trusted watchers
    - Watchers then request key state from published witnesses (after OOBI bootstrap)
    - Witnesses may support push interface such as SSE so that Watchers can subscribe to witness updates of keystate
    - CRitical role of watcher is monotonic view of Key state. First Seen Policy. First seen always seen never unseen.
        - Enables duplicity detection
        - Enables redundancy high availability
        - Reconcilable duplicity
    - Juror and Judge Deciders
    - Juror difference between watcher is that Juror reports duplicity whereas watcher just drops
    -

- Terms and understanding - Henk
    2. 'Backer' and 'Witness', are these a 100% synonym? And if so: why not use 'backer' and keep repeating now and again that it's about a synomym. If not: what's the exact difference?

- Discuss `did:keri` further usage (see Slack #general channel)
    - registrant. Need to update registered version to reference WoT repo not DIF repo
    - did:keri is a very loose wrapper around the KERI prefix, it's there for adoption
    - Maybe it's a good idea to invent a URN specific for KERI

- KERI incubation within IETF: work item under some WG / WG on its own...?
    - KERI presented to Blockchain WG; in the future perhaps hosted within this WG
    - We have to have a draft spec first. Then you form a (work item within a) working group to discuss the spec.
- Michal question: A lightweight protocol for streaming authentic data in  environments with unstable internet connection. Would CESR make sense?
    - Yes, we are able to create a UDP (asynchronous communication) version. It's easier to make UDP reliable than to make TCP scalable.
- GLEIF MultiSig demo KLI (command line version)
    - Two ways of reaching the threshold of a multisig by participant in a rotation event, is by sharing all public addresses among the group of possible signers. If you don't want to disclose pubic keys to other participants, then you could use digests of the public keys in a partial rotation event, where we only need the participating signers to reach the threshold; this subgroups needs to disclose their public keys.
- IETF CESR  variable length codes

            - Listen on two ports TCP and HTTP
                - If TCP then assumes direct mode
                - IF HTTP then assumes indirect mode
            - Witness Hosts also provide a MailBox service with HTTP SSE (server sent events)
                - Controller of witnesses subscribes to SSE stream on Mailbox to read responses to its witness queries
